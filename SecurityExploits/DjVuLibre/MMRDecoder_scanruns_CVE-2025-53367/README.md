# Proof of concept for DjVuLibre CVE-2025-53367

At this time, we are only sharing @antonio-morales's original
fuzzer-generated poc, so that people can quickly test whether they're
running a vulnerable version of DjVuLibre.  This poc only causes the
DjVuLibre library to crash. We are delaying publication of our more
sophisticated poc, which is able to bypass ASLR and gain code
execution.
