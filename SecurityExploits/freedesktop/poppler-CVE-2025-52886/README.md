# Proof of concept for poppler CVE-2025-52886

CVE-2025-52886 is a use-after-free vulnerability in
[poppler](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler), caused by a
reference count overflow. Reference counting was done with a 32-bit
counter, which meant it was feasible to overflow the counter. In my
testing, it took approximately 12 hours to overflow the counter
though, so the risk of exploitation was low.

This directory contains the code for building the proof-of-concept. To
run it:

```bash
make
./pdfgen > poc.pdf
```

Notice that the size of the generated PDF is only 3104 bytes.  Now try
to either open the PDF or run a command line application like
`pdftohtml` on it.
